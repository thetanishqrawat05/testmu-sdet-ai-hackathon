# TestMu SDET AI Hackathon

Playwright + TypeScript automation project for validating core user journeys on [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com).

## Overview

This repository is a clean starter automation framework focused on reliability and maintainability.

- UI test coverage for login and access control flows
- API smoke check for application availability
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Playwright HTML reporting with retry traces/screenshots/videos
- Small utility for AI-friendly failure explanation (`utils/llmFailureExplainer.ts`)

## Tech Stack

- `@playwright/test`
- `TypeScript`
- `Node.js`
- `dotenv`
- `groq-sdk` (available for future AI-driven extensions)

## Project Structure

```

## Current Test Coverage

- `tests/login.spec.ts`
  - Valid user login (`standard_user`) and successful navigation to inventory page
- `tests/dashboard.spec.ts`
  - Locked user login attempt and expected error validation
- `tests/api.spec.ts`
  - Basic API-level availability check for homepage

## Configuration Highlights

From `playwright.config.ts`:

- Base URL: `https://www.saucedemo.com`
- Parallel execution enabled
- Retries: `1` on CI, `0` locally
- Tracing, screenshots, and videos enabled on first retry/failure
- Browser project: Chromium (`Desktop Chrome`)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Install Playwright browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### 3. List discovered tests

```bash
npm run test:list
```

### 4. Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

### 5. Run in headed mode

```bash
npm run test:headed
```

### 6. Type-check only

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

## Reporting

- HTML report is generated by Playwright.
- To open report after execution:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Scripts

Defined in `package.json`:

- `npm test` -> Run Playwright suite
- `npm run test:list` -> List tests without execution
- `npm run test:headed` -> Run tests with browser UI
- `npm run typecheck` -> TypeScript compile check (`--noEmit`)

## Notes

- `dotenv` is already wired in config (`loadEnv()`), so env-based configuration can be added without structural changes.
- `.env`, `node_modules`, and generated reports are excluded via `.gitignore`.

## Roadmap

- Add Page Object Model for better reuse
- Add negative API scenarios and response contract checks
- Add CI workflow (GitHub Actions) for PR validation
- Add test data management and environment profiles

If you are evaluating this as part of an SDET exercise, this project is ready for extension into a production-style automation framework.
